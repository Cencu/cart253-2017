# CART 253 2017 lecture slides

The slides for each lecture will be made available here after each class. The slides are written using [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) and can be read in that format here, but can also be viewed as a presentation by going to the URLs that will be listed below. (If you're interested, the presentations are created from the Markdown using a JavaScript library called [Remark.js](https://remarkjs.com/#1).)
